				<h4>Sido is the Arabic word for grandpa, it’s what we called him, Sido Abed.</h4>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>My Grandfather Abdelnour Hindeleh was born in <a href="yafa.html">Yafa</a> in 1931, the eldest of 5 children.</p>
				<p>He spent his whole childhood there. He was like any other child, carefree and happy.</p>
				<p>He worked at his <a href="trip.html#greendoor">father’s shop</a> from a young age, where he gained a work ethic that he would have for life.</p>
				<p>He went to Terra Santa school, a Catholic school run by Franciscan fathers. Graduating at the top of his class at just the age of 16. He was immediately given a teaching post the following year, this is where his passion for learning and teaching flourished.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>And then the Nakba.</strong></p>

					<p>The year was 1948, ‘the Hagana’ (A Jewish paramilitary organization), went on the offensive. Leading to the mass exodus at gun point of around 120,000 of Yafa’s citizens, of whom my grandfather and his family were a part of.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>No one knew how things will turn out. In the beginning, everyone was told it is only a matter of a few days, a week or two at the most and everyone would return, till the fighting quietens down.</p>

				<p>Most families like my great grandfather left all their possessions, including money, gold, title deeds inside their houses buried in a secret place.</p>
				<p>My great grandfather was a businessman and had a lot of cash and title deeds, they put it in a copper cooking container, dug a hole in the house and buried it there. My grandfather who was only 17 at the time told his father and uncle to take some of the cash in case they need it on their short absence from the house. Little did they know that was the only money they will ever have.</p>
				<p>People escaped to many of the neighbouring countries, some even by boat overseas before the ports were closed.</p>
				<p>My grandfather’s family decided to go to Egypt by the way of Gaza. However it was no open passage, they had to wait to be processed, and what they were told was going to be two days, turned into six months.</p>
				<p>I recall my grandfather telling me that not everyone was allowed to leave. Men who were of age were sent back. My Grandfather was 17 at this point, and he told me he used to shave his face, legs, and arms to appear younger. He used to hide on top of the bunk beds to avoid the searches at night.</p>
				<p>But finally, they were able to make it through.</p>

					<p>This would be the start of his new life. His father would shortly pass, and he would be tasked with providing for his family, all in a new country he is not familiar with.</p>
					<p>One thing he knew was that he wanted to pursue an education, and with almost no money in his pocket, but a lot of confidence in himself, he applied to The American University in Cairo, Egypt.</p>

					<p>He and my father then went on to start a successful family business utilising his scientific knowledge to build science labs for the local schools.</p>

					<p>My Grandpa passed away in January 2019, leaving behind a long rich history and legacy.</p>
					<p>One of his last stories that he told us was about a poem they were taught at school. He remembered it while he was in hospital as it was cold, windy, and rainy outside.</p>
					<p>I think it perfectly embodies the resilience and determination he had.</p>
					<p>The poem goes:<br></p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">The roof of my house is Metal, and the walls are stone</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">May you blow your wind, and may the trees cry</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Thunder your storms, I don’t fear danger.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">.<br>.</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">From my little lamp I will draw my sight</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">The roof of my house is Metal, and the walls are stone</p>
