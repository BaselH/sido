				<h4>So close, yet so far.</h4>
				<p>Even though I lived in Jordan, right across the border from Palestine, I have only ever visited twice. I have always known that’s where my family comes from, but it was hard to imagine what it’s like.</p>
				<p>Two years ago, I visited Palestine for the second time. Being older I was able to appreciate it much more, we went where we could, visited Jerusalem and the old city, bethlehem, Yafa and Haifa.</p>
				<p>Not many get to experience the beauty of Palestine, as it is very hard for any Arab to gain access. We as Australian citizens had a certain privilege to go, and even then, we were stopped at the border for an absurd amount of time, without our passports and with no updates.</p>
				<p>We stayed in one of the few hotels owned by a Palestinian, a family friend of my mom’s Uncle, it was in east Jerusalem, one street away from the Old City of Jerusalem. We decided to stay there to experience the atmosphere of the Palestinian side. There is a significant Israeli military presence everywhere, the streets are not maintained, and the buildings were old and crumbling as no one was allowed to do any restoration work.</p>
				<p>We visited the old city, which is filled with souvenir shops, there are four quarters in there, a Muslim quarter, a Christian quarter, a Jewish quarter, and an Armenian quarter, however people of different sects lived in different quarters, it didn’t matter.</p>
				<p>We visited the three holiest religious sites in the old city. Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and we were even allowed to go in to see the wailing wall, but the mosque was closed for tourists, and unfortunately, just the next day shooting broke out and the mosque was closed down for the first time in 17 years, and we missed our chance.</p>
				<p>We then followed the “Way of Suffering”, it is told Jesus walked it carrying the cross. My Grandma’s school, Notre dame de Sion, is built on top of the third point of the pathway. The walls, floors, and ceilings were all made of rock, there were caves, and streams of water, it is incredible to think this was a school, it’s more appropriate as a museum, which it is now.</p>

				<h4>Yafa and Haifa</h4>
				<p>The next day we drove and went to visit Yafa and Heifa. We were leaving the West Bank, and so we had to go through security, and pass through the “Separation Wall”. They all had graffiti painted on them, most with imagery of peace and resistance.</p>
				<p>We were going to find our roots, the family houses, shops, and schools. We knew it wasn’t going to be easy, places are hardly ever the same 70 years later, let alone in a place where the landscape was intentionally changed. All we had to go by was landmarks, because even street names were changed.</p>

				<div class="split">
					<p>Based on the memory of Amo Nicola (my mom’s aunt’s husband, just before he passed) and <a href="sido.html">Sido Abed</a>, we drew rough maps of what they remember from their childhoods, street names, famous buildings, anything that will help us make our way through.</p>
					<p>They were not perfect, but they were enough, after all they left at a young age, and trying to recall memories from 70 years ago.</p>
					<p>We asked the locals if they remembered the old street names, some of the people who never left did, and they pointed us in the right direction. It is sad to realise that soon this will all be lost, there is very little documentation of this lost history.</p>

					<p>We were successful in finding some of the locations. We found my great grandfathers green doored shop – the one my grandfather worked in while he was in school. We found the Terra Santa school. The <a href="issa.html">Elissa</a> family home.</p>

				<p>All in all, this trip was one of the best I have taken in my life. It was personal, not just tourism. Each little bit we saw had a history, one that I was connected to.</p>
				<p>It is truly my Homeland.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Here are some of the many photos I took on this trip, each on their own marker.</p>
